# How to Apply Your DroidTheme on Android

You have created a stunning new look using DroidTheme AI. Here is how to make it a reality on your phone.

## Step 1: Save the Wallpaper
1.  In the DroidTheme app, scroll down to the **Wallpaper** section.
2.  Tap the **Save Wallpaper (PNG)** button.
3.  The image will be downloaded to your phone's **Gallery** or **Downloads** folder.

## Step 2: Set the Wallpaper
1.  Open your phone's **Photos** or **Gallery** app.
2.  Find the image you just downloaded.
3.  Tap the **Menu** button (three dots or share icon).
4.  Select **Use as** > **Photos Wallpaper** (or **Wallpaper**).
5.  Adjust the position if needed and tap **Set Wallpaper**.

## Step 3: Match System Colors (Material You)
*For Android 12, 13, 14, and newer (Pixel, Samsung OneUI, Motorola, etc.)*

Android's "Material You" engine will automatically try to pull colors from your new wallpaper. To ensure it matches your DroidTheme creation perfectly:

1.  Go to your phone's home screen.
2.  **Long press** on an empty space.
3.  Select **Wallpaper & style**.
4.  Tap on **Wallpaper colors** (or **Color palette**).
5.  You will see several color combinations generated from your wallpaper. Pick the one that closely resembles the **Primary** and **Secondary** colors you saw in the DroidTheme preview.
6.  Ensure **Themed icons** is toggled **ON** if you want your supported app icons to match the color scheme.

## Step 4: Advanced Icon Styling (Optional)
DroidTheme simulates specific icon styles (Minimal, Outline, etc.). To get this exact look:

*   **Pixel Launcher**: Enable "Themed Icons" in Wallpaper & style settings.
*   **Samsung OneUI**: Use the "Good Lock" app (Theme Park module) to customize icon colors and shapes.
*   **Third-Party Launchers** (Nova, Niagara): Download an icon pack from the Play Store that matches the style you selected (e.g., search for "White Line Icon Pack" if you chose the Outline style).

## Step 5: Save Your Theme Data
If you want to remember these specific settings or color codes for later:
1.  Tap **Save JSON** in the DroidTheme app.
2.  Save this file to your Google Drive or Files app. You can import it back into DroidTheme later to view the exact Hex codes.
